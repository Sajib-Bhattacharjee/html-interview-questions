## 6. 📄 HTML Semantics

### ❓ Question 1: What is semantic HTML, and why is it important?

**💡 Answer:**  
Semantic HTML uses tags that convey meaning (e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`), improving:

- **🦾 Accessibility:** Assists screen readers in interpreting content.
- **🌐 SEO:** Enhances search engine understanding.
- **🔧 Maintainability:** Makes code more readable and structured.

---

### ❓ Question 2: 🛠️ How do semantic tags improve webpage structure?

**💡 Answer:**  
Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>` organize content logically:

- `<header>`: Introductory content or navigation.
- `<footer>`: Closing info like copyrights.
- `<section>`: Thematic content grouping.

---

### ❓ Question 3: 🆚 Compare `<div>` with semantic elements like `<main>` and `<article>`.

**💡 Answer:**

- `<div>`: Non-semantic; used for styling/layout.
- `<main>`: Marks the main content of a page.
- `<article>`: Self-contained, reusable blocks (e.g., blog posts).  
  Semantic elements improve structure, accessibility, and SEO.

---

### ❓ Question 4: 🚀 How does semantic HTML enhance accessibility?

**💡 Answer:**  
Semantic elements improve the experience for assistive technologies:

- `<nav>`: Signifies navigation links.
- `<aside>`: Indicates complementary content.
- `<main>`: Highlights the main content for screen readers.

---

### ❓ Question 5: 📜 What’s the difference between `<section>` and `<article>`?

**💡 Answer:**

- **`<section>`:** Groups related content within a document.
- **`<article>`:** Represents standalone content that can be reused.

---

## 7. ⚙️ Advanced HTML Concepts

### ❓ Question 6: 🌱 What is the `<template>` element, and how is it used?

**💡 Answer:**  
The `<template>` holds reusable HTML that isn’t rendered until needed.  
**Example:**

```html
<template id="example-template">
  <p>This is reusable!</p>
</template>
<script>
  const content = document
    .getElementById("example-template")
    .content.cloneNode(true);
  document.body.appendChild(content);
</script>
```

### ❓ Question 7: ✏️ What is the purpose of `contenteditable`?

#### 💡 Answer:

It makes elements editable by users.

#### Example:

```html
<div contenteditable="true">Edit this text!</div>
```

### ❓ Question 8: 🔗 How do custom data attributes (`data-*`) work?

#### 💡 Answer:

They store additional data on elements, accessible via JavaScript.

#### Example:

```html
<div data-user-id="123">User Name</div>
<script>
  console.log(document.querySelector("[data-user-id]").dataset.userId); // Outputs: 123
</script>
```

### ❓ Question 9: 📤 What is the `<dialog>` element?

#### 💡 Answer:

A native modal dialog box for displaying popups.

#### Example:

```html
<dialog open>This is a dialog box!</dialog>
```

### ❓ Question 10: 🖼️ How does the `srcset` attribute improve image loading?

#### 💡 Answer:

`srcset` allows responsive images for different devices.

#### Example:

```html
<img
  src="default.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 480w, large.jpg 1024w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px, 1024px"
  alt="Responsive Image"
/>
```

### ❓ Question 11: ⚡ What are async and defer in `<script>`?

#### 💡 Answer:

- **`async`:** Loads the script asynchronously and executes it as soon as it’s ready.
- **`defer`:** Loads the script but executes it only after the DOM is fully parsed.

**Usage:**

- Use `async` for scripts that are independent of the DOM.
- Use `defer` for scripts that are dependent on the DOM.

### ❓ Question 12: 💤 How does lazy loading optimize performance?

#### 💡 Answer:

Lazy loading defers the loading of non-essential assets (like images) until they are needed, improving initial page load time.

#### Example:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Lazy Loaded Image" />
```

# 8. 🚀 Performance Optimization

### ❓ Question 13: 📦 What is `<link rel="preload">`?

#### 💡 Answer:

`<link rel="preload">` preloads essential resources (like stylesheets, scripts, or images) to improve loading performance.

#### Example:

```html
<link rel="preload" href="styles.css" as="style" />
```

### ❓ Question 14: 🖼️ How can images be optimized for performance?

#### 💡 Answer:

- Use modern formats like WebP for better compression.
- Compress images to reduce their file size.
- Apply `srcset` for responsive loading, adjusting to different screen sizes.
- Implement lazy loading to defer image loading until needed.

---

### ❓ Question 15: ✂️ What is the difference between minification and compression?

#### 💡 Answer:

- **Minification:** Removes unnecessary characters from code (e.g., spaces, comments) to reduce file size without affecting functionality.
- **Compression:** Reduces file size through algorithms (e.g., Gzip) to improve transfer speed.

---

### ❓ Question 16: 🌍 How does a CDN improve performance?

#### 💡 Answer:

A CDN (Content Delivery Network) caches content on servers worldwide, reducing latency by serving assets from the nearest server, which improves page load speed.

---

### ❓ Question 17: 🛠️ What are service workers, and how do they help?

#### 💡 Answer:

Service workers are scripts that run in the background to manage caching and enable offline functionality, improving load times and allowing offline usage.

#### Example:

```javascript
self.addEventListener("install", (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches
      .open("cache-v1")
      .then((cache) => cache.addAll(["/index.html", "/style.css"]))
  );
});
```

### ❓ Question 18: 🖌️ What is critical CSS?

#### 💡 Answer:

Critical CSS is the minimum CSS required to render above-the-fold content, improving perceived load speed by inlining it directly in the HTML.

---

### ❓ Question 19: 📡 How does HTTP/2 enhance performance?

#### 💡 Answer:

HTTP/2 supports multiplexing, allowing multiple requests over a single connection. This reduces latency and improves page load speed by allowing faster resource fetching.

---

### ❓ Question 20: ⏩ What is `rel="prefetch"`, and when is it used?

#### 💡 Answer:

`rel="prefetch"` hints to the browser to fetch resources in advance for future navigation, optimizing load times when the user navigates to the next page.

#### Example:

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="next-page.html" />
```
